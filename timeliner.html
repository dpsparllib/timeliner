						<h3>29 and 30 March, 1901</h3>
						<p>
						Australia’s first Commonwealth election was essentially six separate elections held over two days, as each state conducted an election in accordance with its own electoral laws and practices. Three loosely-affiliated political groups contested the election: the Protectionists led by Edmund Barton, the Free Traders led by George Reid and a collection of Labor candidates. No one group attained the majority required to form Government outright, with the Protectionists taking 31 seats in the House of Representatives, the Free Traders 28 seats, Labor candidates 14 seats and independents two seats. The Barton Protectionists formed government reliant upon the support of the Labor members. Reid and the Free Traders formed the official Opposition.
						</p>
						<p>
						Labor candidates similarly held the balance of power in the Senate claiming eight seats to the Free Traders’ 17 seats and the Protectionists’ 11 seats. Labor’s general preference for Protectionist policy ensured a Senate that was generally supportive of the Government.

						<h3>December 16, 1903</h3>
						<p>
						This was the first election held under Commonwealth electoral legislation. First Past the Post was the electoral system. Once again no one political group gained a majority of Representative seats, with the Protectionists winning 26 seats, the Free Traders 25 seats and Labor 23 seats. One independent candidate also claimed a seat. The relative equality of the three parties made the task of governing difficult, with the possibility of coalitions explored. Despite this uncertainty, the Deakin Protectionists continued in office with the support of the Labor members.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Labor Party (also referred to throughout as the Australian Labor Party or ALP) gained a pronounced swing in the Senate contest, winning 10 out of the 19 vacancies. Party representation in the upper house was now 14 Labor, 12 Free Trade, eight Protectionists and two independents.

						<h3>December 12, 1906</h3>
						<p>
						The multi-party contest for control of the House of Representatives continued at the 1906 election with the distribution of seats being: 26 Labor, 27 Anti-Socialists, 16 Protectionists, four Independent Protectionists and two Western Australian Party members.
						</p>
						<p>
						A tentative understanding reached between Deakin and the Labor Party during the election campaign ensured that the Protectionists continued in government, dependent upon the support of the Labor members.
						</p>
						<p>
						In the Senate election the Anti-Socialists had the most success, winning 11 out of the 19 vacancies. Labor won five seats and the Protectionists claimed two seats. The makeup of the Senate was now 15 Anti-Socialists, 15 Labor, four Protectionists and two independents.
						</p>
						<p>
						The third Senate seat in South Australia, won by the Anti-Socialists, was declared void in 1907 because ballot papers could not be found when a recount was ordered. The appointment of a replacement senator, from the Labor Party, was subsequently declared void later in 1907 and the ensuing election for that third Senate seat in early 1908 saw the Anti-Socialists regain the seat.

						<h3>April 13, 1910</h3>
						<p>
						The 1910 election has been the only Commonwealth election to have taken place due to the effluxion of time. The amalgamation of the non-Labor groups during the third parliament ensured that only two major political parties contested the election: the Labor Party led by Andrew Fisher and the Liberal Party led by Alfred Deakin. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Labor won a substantial victory to become the first party to win a clear majority in both houses of parliament. Labor received a swing of 13.4 per cent across the country which was translated into a net gain of 17 seats. In the House of Representatives Labor held 43 seats to the Liberals’ 31 seats, with one independent. 
						</p>
						<p>
						The Labor Party’s nation-wide support was affirmed in the Senate election, with Labor candidates winning all of the 18 vacancies. Labor held 23 Senate seats and the Liberals held 13 seats.
